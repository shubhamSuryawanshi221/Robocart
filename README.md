# 🤖 Robocart – Smart E-Commerce Platform for Robotics Components

**Robocart** is an innovative final year project developed to simplify the online purchase of robotics-related components. The platform provides a seamless and user-friendly interface where students, hobbyists, and professionals can explore, select, and order various electronic and mechanical parts essential for their robotic projects.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Browse & Search:** Easily find robotics components by name or category.
- 🛒 **Cart System:** Add, remove, and manage items in the shopping cart.
- 💳 **Checkout Functionality:** Simple checkout flow for completing purchases.
- 📦 **Component Categories:** Organized listing of sensors, motors, microcontrollers, modules, etc.
